# prometheus-react

Hi. Thank you for the opportunity to interview. This is the README for the repo. There are 2 folders. One for the `API` and one for the `client`, aptly named!

The code compiles and runs.

### What has been implemented
- ReactJS app (via `create-react-app`)
- Express app (via `express-generator`)

## Tools used
- `Luxon` time library (to ease parsing of time)
- `express-prometheus-middleware` - I enjoyed implementing this time-series metrics library
